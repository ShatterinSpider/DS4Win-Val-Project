# DS4Win-Val-Project
This is a small project I've been working on for the past.. 2ish years? It started out because I didn't want to buy ReWASD, and use DS4 Windows instead to play valorant with my controller. After testing, and perfecting my profiles I figured out how to essentially match my controller and mouse gameplay.
